# Railspics app *STAGE 1*
**Rails Girls Colombia**


This is the base repository for the Railspics app to be used in Rails Girls 2016.
The app is meant to be built in different stages. *Stage 1* creates the markup and styling for the app without the use of any preprocessors, build systems or frameworks in order to teach the core concepts of `HTML` and `CSS`. This file shows the finished product which will be used as a starter for *Stage 2*.

The different views of the app are written in 3 files following the rails naming convention for views.
- index.html
- show.html
- new.html

## Usage
1. Download or clone repository
2. Open the folder in your code editor
3. Open one of the html files with your Google Chrome (preferably)
4. Start coding!

### Notes
The css folder contains a [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) which *makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing*
